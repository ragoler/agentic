1.  **Architecture:** Read `.conductor/architecture.md` to understand the technical design.
2.  **Tasks:** Read `.conductor/plan.md` to see the complete task breakdown.
3.  **Workflow:** Read `.conductor/workflow.md` for the development process.
4.  **Current Status:** Read `.conductor/status.md` to see what's been done.
5.  **Code Style:** Review `.conductor/code_styleguide.md` for coding standards.
6.  **Prose Style:** Review `.conductor/prose_styleguide.md` for UI text guidelines.
